## **Troubleshooting**
**The TV guide is not being populated:**\
Check the [XMLTV guide](http://localhost:13681/xmltv).
If it just shows the list of channels with nothing below them, the provider likely does not supply a guide.
Try switching to a different provider.

**I've modified the channels, but Plex isn't changing:**\
You must delete the DVR from Plex and re-add it to see changes.

**Error getting channel data for [Portal], skipping** or **Error making XMLTV for [Portal], skipping:**\
Go to the Portals page, select the malfunctioning portal and click "Retest". You likely have an expired MAC address.

**Channels not loading in editor:**\
Ensure your portals are configured correctly and MAC addresses are valid. Check the Dashboard logs for specific errors.

**Duplicate detection not working:**\
The system only considers enabled channels as duplicates. Disable a channel to remove it from duplicate detection.

## **Known Issues**

Channel logos may not display when viewed in a browser. This is likely due to your browser's security settings related to HTTP files being served on an HTTPS domain.\

![Firefox](https://evilvir.us/application/files/9217/3318/2583/firefox_https_issue.png)

This issue does not occur with [PLEX HTPC](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFFF6NN1LZDQ?ocid=pdpshare), the mobile apps, or the TV app. To watch from a PC, use [PLEX HTPC](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFFF6NN1LZDQ?ocid=pdpshare). If any logos are still missing, it means the provider isn't supplying them.

For Plex HTPC, you must enable **Force Direct Play** in the settings.
